WHAT IS AUDITING?

Auditing is the monitoring and recording of configured database actions, from both databases users and nondatabase users.

Nondatabase users refers to application users who are recognized in the database using the CLIENT_IDENTIFIER attribute.



In previous release of Oracle Database, there were separate audit trails for individual component:

SYS.AUD$ for the database audit trail
SYS.FGA_LOG$ for find-grained auditing
DVSYS.AUDIT_TRAILS$ for Oracle Database Vault, Oracle Label Security and so on.

In this release, these audit trails are all unified into one, viewable from the UNIFIED_AUDIT_TRAIL data dictionary
view for single-instance installations or Oracle Database Real Application Clusters environments.



As part of the unified audit trail enhancement, a new schema, AUDSYS will 
be used sollel for storage of the unified audit trail data table. the existing
audit data in the AUD$ and FGA_LOG$ system tables, audit metadata, and audit 
PL/SQL package, will continue to reside in the SYS schema.
