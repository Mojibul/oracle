The following guidelines can be used while creating temporary tablespaces:

•	 Create as many temp files as the number of instances in every temp tablespace. For example,
in an eight-instance database, there should be at least eight temp files associated with every
temporary tablespace. This strategy reduces the file header level locking issues dramatically.

•	 While adding an instance to a database, increase the size of temporary tablespace. Also,
increase the number of temp files in temporary tablespaces.

•	 If an application component uses an excessive amount of temporary tablespace, then create
a new user for that application component, create additional temporary tablespace, and use
application affinity to keep that component to a node. This strategy reduces the ill effects
associated with excessive extent caching and uncaching activities.


sql script 

select tablespace_name, INITIAL_EXTENT, NEXT_EXTENT
 from dba_tablespaces
where tablespace_name='TEMP';
